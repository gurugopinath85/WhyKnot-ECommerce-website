# Whyknot eCommerce website
Whyknot is an eCommerce platform I developed for my sister's crochet business. The website provides a seamless shopping experience for a variety of handmade crochet items. Currently, the site features placeholder products, and updates to the actual product listings, logo, and branding will be made soon as the business grows.

# Features
  - Product Listings: View various crochet items with detailed descriptions and prices.
  - Cart Functionality: Add and remove items before checkout.
  - Responsive Design: Accessible across mobile and desktop platforms.
    
# Ongoing Development
I am actively working on the backend and integrating secure transaction APIs/methods (such as Stripe or PayPal) to streamline checkout and payment processing. These integrations will enhance the user experience and ensure secure transactions. Backend improvements are being made to scale the site and manage orders effectively.

# Future Plans
  - Product & Branding Updates: Actual product listings and branding will be updated soon, replacing placeholder content.
  - User Profiles: Implement user accounts to track orders and save wishlists.
  - Payment Integration: Secure payment gateways are being integrated to enable smooth online transactions.

Whyknot is a work in progress and will continue to evolve as the crochet business grows. Stay tuned for product updates and new features! Iâ€™m eager for any feedback so feel free to reach out.
